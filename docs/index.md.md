- Veeam Kasten for Kubernetes Overview
Note
By default, Generic Storage Backup will be disabled for all new
deployments of Veeam Kasten and for existing deployments when upgraded to
version 6.5.0 or later. For more details, refer to this
page.
The Veeam Kasten data management platform, purpose-built for Kubernetes,
provides enterprise operations teams an easy-to-use, scalable, and secure
system for backup/restore, disaster recovery, and mobility of Kubernetes
applications.
Veeam Kastenâs application-centric approach and deep integrations with
relational and NoSQL databases, Kubernetes distributions, and all clouds
provide teams with the freedom of infrastructure choice without sacrificing
operational simplicity. Policy-driven and extensible, Veeam Kasten provides a
native Kubernetes API and includes features such as full-spectrum consistency,
database integrations, automatic application discovery, multi-cloud mobility,
and a powerful web-based user interface.
Given Veeam Kastenâs extensive ecosystem support you have the flexibility to
choose environments (public/ private/ hybrid cloud/ on-prem) and Kubernetes
distributions (cloud vendor managed or self managed) in support of three
principal use cases:
- Backup and Restore
- Disaster Recovery
- Application Mobility

## Veeam Kasten Editions (Free and Enterprise)ï
Veeam Kasten is available in two editions. The default Starter edition,
provided at no charge and intended for evaluation or for use in small
non-production clusters, is functionally the same as the Enterprise
edition but limited from a support and scale perspective. Customers
choosing to upgrade to the Enterprise edition can obtain a license key
from Kasten or install from cloud marketplaces. Please see the
product page
for a comparison of the editions.
