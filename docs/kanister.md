# Kanister Documentation

## Kanister Kanister

Kanister, an extensible open-source framework used by Kasten's Veeam
  Kasten platform, can be used for application-level data management on
  Kubernetes. It allows domain experts to capture application specific
  data management tasks in blueprints which can be easily shared and
  extended. The framework takes care of the tedious details around
  execution on Kubernetes and presents a homogeneous operational
  experience across applications at scale. Further, it gives you a natural
  mechanism to extend the Veeam Kasten platform by adding your own code to
  modify any desired step performed for data lifecycle management.

Below you can find useful resources about the project as well as helpful
  information for testing Veeam Kasten with Kanister-enabled applications.
