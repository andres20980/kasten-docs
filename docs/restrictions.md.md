Here is a list of known limitations in the current Veeam Kasten
release. A number of them will be addressed in upcoming releases.
### On-Premises Storage Providers
Currently, on-premises Veeam Kasten deployments are only supported
if storage is provisioned via the Container Storage Interface (CSI).
With this in mind, the following limitations exist if you have an
unsupported storage provider:
- Applications for which a Kanister blueprint (or a blueprint binding)
is available but does not use volume-snapshots
will be fully supported.
- Any deployments and stateful sets that use a persistent volume that
are not associated with a Kanister blueprint (or a blueprint binding)
will fail on snapshots unless you are using the
Generic Storage Backup and Restore Kanister approach with sidecar containers.
Please refer to Kanister for more details.
### Cloning Applications
When cloning applications, one needs to be aware of both external
dependencies outside of the application namespace as well as
namespace-dependent configuration. For example, if there is a
duplicated ingress setup, they will conflict and the results might be
non-deterministic.
### Restore
Please refer to Limitations for restore
limitations.
### Migration Restrictions
- Multi and hybrid-cloud volume migration is fully supported as long
as Veeam Kasten has support for snapshots on the source side. For
unsupported storage providers, please use Kanister for now.
- When migrating Kanister-enabled applications across clusters, the
destination cluster also needs access to all buckets where Kanister
artifacts are stored. This restriction will be removed in an
upcoming release where Kanister artifacts will be copied into the
migration bucket.
### GitOps Managed Applications
When restoring applications that are managed by external controllers,
one needs to be aware of the following conditions.
- An external controller can interrupt Veeam Kasten
operations that may lead to restore failures.
Ensure that there is no external controller handling
the resource lifecycle during the restore by disabling the
auto-sync mechanism in the GitOps tools used,
or scaling down the controller, etc.
- To avoid conflict with external controller after the restore has
taken place, it is recommended that you perform a data-only restore.
Please refer to Data-Only Restore
for more details.
### TLS Version Compatibility
Kasten currently supports TLS version 1.2 and 1.3, but it has limitations
on the cipher suites, elliptic curves, and signature algorithms it allows.
Cipher Suites
TLS Version
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
1.2
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
1.3
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
Curves
P-256
P-384
P-521
For the following signature algorithms, the ECDSA implementations are
constrained to specific curves in TLS 1.3.
Signature Algorithms
Hash
RSASSA-PSS
SHA256
SHA384
SHA512
RSASSA-PKCS1
ECDSA with P-256
ECDSA with P-384
ECDSA with P-512
### Limitations in FIPS mode
Enabling FIPS mode may result in certain features that are unavailable
due to non-compliance with the algorithms used. For more information regarding
the distinct features and their installation limitations,
please see the FIPS section.
It is important to note that importing non-FIPS compliant data into a FIPS
compliant version of Kasten will not be possible.
### Running without a cluster-admin ClusterRole
Veeam Kasten requires a ServiceAccount bound with the ClusterRole
cluster-admin in order to properly backup and restore resources within your
cluster. The default ServiceAccount used by Veeam Kasten, k10-k10, already
comes preconfigured with this ClusterRole.
Installing Veeam Kasten without the cluster-admin ClusterRole bound to a
provided ServiceAccount is not supported.
